# Sample-Documents
Sample documents of proofs, solutions to exams, and notes, written during my computer science degree. 

- **ProofTheory.pdf** corresponds to the notes taken while reading the book "Structural Proof Theory" by
  Sara Negri and Jan Von Plato. The notes include concepts from the first 3 chapters of the book, like the 
  admissibility of the cut rule in G3ip. The notes were taken in English

- **Algorithms1.pdf** and **Algorithms2.pdf** correspond to solutions of two exams of the
  analysis and design of algorithms course. In them, there are mathematical specifications
  of algorithms, proofs of the correctness of such algorithms, and implementations of the 
  solutions as pseudocode or python code. The solutions were written in Spanish.

- **ModernAlgebra1.pdf** and **ModernAlgebra2.pdf** correspond to solutions of two short exams of the
  modern algebra course. In them, there are proofs of some theorems about Rings. The solutions were written in Spanish.
